# Seizure Detection Codebase used in Neureka Challenge 2020

## Contents

1. DNN - Directory containing codes and scripts related to the U-Net neural network used in seizure detection
2. Preprocessing - Code related to the two major preprocessing pipeline applied to the data.
3. Postprocessing - LSTM based fusion of the three different NN predictions. This is followed by a set of postprocessing rules which converts the LSTM output seizure annotations.
4. Seizure Detection Pipeline-Description.docx - An MS Word document describing the seizure prediction pipeline briefly.
